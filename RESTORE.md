# Database & Code Restore Log

Date: 2025-10-25

Summary:
- User restored the SQLite database from backup file `pump_management.db.bak_20251025214542` by running the copy command in the project root. That backup is now the active `pump_management.db`.
- The Git branch `feature/wells-fields` was reset to commit `c7eb6cb` (the commit that removed the separate details view and routed users to the maintenance page). The reset was a hard reset + force-push.

Commands executed (by user / operator):

```powershell
copy .\pump_management.db.bak_20251025214542 .\pump_management.db
git reset --hard c7eb6cb
git push --force origin feature/wells-fields
```

Verification performed:
- The smoke test script `scripts/test_create_maintenance.py` was run against the restored DB and returned:

```
{'success': True, 'message': 'عملیات تعمیرات با موفقیت ثبت شد', 'maintenance_id': 11, 'changed_fields': '["current_pipe_diameter", "current_pipe_length_m"]'}
```

Notes & recommendations:
- Backups created earlier by migration scripts are still present in the project root. If you later want to re-apply the schema changes that removed `current_pump_phase` and `current_pipe_specs`, keep those backups and the migration files handy.
- If other team members pulled the branch before the forced push, they will need to run `git fetch` and `git reset --hard origin/feature/wells-fields` (or re-clone) to align.
- Consider adding a short process doc for running migrations and DB backups (or use a migration tool) so future schema changes are reversible without surprises.

Next steps (optional):
- Open the app in the browser and confirm the maintenance page loads correctly for a few wells.
- Run any other smoke tests you rely on.
- If you want, I can add a quick script `scripts/restore_db.sh` / `restore_db.ps1` to streamline DB restores in the future.
